Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: It‚Äôs been a wild few days for the US economy. President Donald Trump‚Äôs jabs at Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell are affecting markets. Investors are ringing alarm bells with the assets they‚Äôre buying and mostly selling ‚Äì and suddenly making comparisons to the Great Depression. And everyone from the International Monetary Fund to Trump‚Äôs billionaire friends are issuing stark warnings about his massive tariffs. Here‚Äôs what you might have missed this week. Presidential relationships can change, but Trump has taken that to an extreme. After calling the Fed chair (whom he appointed in 2018) ‚Äúa major loser‚Äù whose ‚Äútermination cannot come soon enough last week, Trump seemed to soften up on Tuesday. He said he had ‚Äúno intention‚Äù of firing Powell after advisers warned that terminating the central bank chief would backfire legally and economically, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. But the president‚Äôs outlook soured by Wednesday. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt called him. I might call him,‚Äù Trump said in an Oval Office executive action signing ceremony Wednesday evening. ‚ÄúI believe he‚Äôs making a mistake by not lowering interest rates, and I think, as well as we‚Äôre doing, we could do much better.‚Äù On Wednesday, Trump said he could reimpose ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù tariffs on some countries in as soon as two or three weeks. The president had set a 90-day pause on his massive so-called reciprocal tariffs, which aren‚Äôt technically reciprocal, earlier this month to spur negotiations with other countries. ‚ÄúIn the end, I think what‚Äôs going to happen is, we‚Äôre going to have a great deals, and by the way, if we don‚Äôt have a deal with a company or a country, we‚Äôre going to set the tariff,‚Äù Trump said in an Oval Office ceremony. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd say over the next couple of weeks, wouldn‚Äôt you say? I think so. Over the next two, three weeks. We‚Äôll be setting the number.‚Äù If he reimposes the tariffs, it would be a significant re-escalation in the global trade war. The stock market has been on a rollercoaster this week. Investors started with a steep Monday sell-off after Trump‚Äôs attacks on Powell. The dollar tumbled to a three-year low, and nearly every company in the Dow and the S&P 500 closed lower. Shares modestly rebounded Tuesday after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told investors that the US-China trade war is unsustainable and that he expects the battle to de-escalate, a person familiar with the matter confirmed to CNN. Stocks soared on Wednesday, but Trump still has a long way to go to ease investors‚Äô fears. Despite the two-day rally, the S&P 500 has shed $6.5 trillion in market value since its record high in February, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. Meanwhile, US crude oil has tumbled as investors fear a recession could tank demand. And US Treasury yields, which trade in opposite direction to prices, have surged in recent weeks. The IMF released a stark warning for the global economy and US prosperity in a Tuesday report. ‚ÄúWe are entering a new era as the global economic system that has operated for the last 80 years is being reset,‚Äù the IMF said, predicting rapidly slowing economic growth ‚Äì particularly in the United States ‚Äì and reignited US inflation. South Korea‚Äôs Customs Service also reported that exports for the first 20 days of April declined by 5.2% compared to the same period last year ‚Äì a sign for where global trade is heading under Trump‚Äôs tariff agenda. Billionaires are becoming more and more vocal about the economic consequences of Trump‚Äôs tariffs. Hedge fund Citadel CEO Ken Griffin, a supporter of the president, said Wednesday that tariffs are hurting America‚Äôs position in the world. ‚ÄúThe United States was more than just a nation. It‚Äôs a brand. It‚Äôs a universal brand, whether it‚Äôs our culture, our financial strength, our military strength,‚Äù Griffin said at the Semafor World Economy Summit in Washington. ‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôre eroding that brand right now.‚Äù Griffin joins the list of wealthy business leaders diverging from the president. Last week, Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, one of the world‚Äôs largest hedge funds, said Trump‚Äôs tariffs helped push America close to a recession ‚Äî or perhaps even ‚Äúsomething worse.‚Äù Most stock quote data provided by BATS.
