Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump in the 2020 election and became the United States‚Äô 46th president when he was inaugurated a few months later. He initially ran for a second term, but he announced a few months before the election that he would be withdrawing from the race. His decision came a few weeks after a disastrous debate performance that had Democratic allies calling for him to step aside and ‚Äúpass the torch‚Äù for the good of the party and the country. Biden threw his support behind Vice President Kamala Harris, who went on to secure the Democratic nomination. For more than 35 years, Biden represented Delaware in the US Senate. He resigned in 2009 to become vice president under Barack Obama. He ran for president in 1988 and 2008 before breaking through in 2020. At the time, he was the oldest president-elect in US history. © 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved. CNN Sans ‚Ñ¢ & ¬© 2016 Cable News Network.
