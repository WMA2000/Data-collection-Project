Jamie Miller is extremely troubled. He might only be a 13-year-old character in a fictional television show called ‚ÄúAdolescence,‚Äù but his story has prompted widespread consternation about the plight of disaffected men who feel dangerously isolated and alone. Even if you haven‚Äôt seen the four-part British drama series, which has rapidly become the top streaming Netflix show in 75 countries, you will likely know that his character is drawn into a world of misogyny and hyper-masculinity, radicalized online and arrested for killing a female school mate.
