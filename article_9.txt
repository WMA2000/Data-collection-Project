In the first major election night of 2025, a liberal judge won a critical Supreme Court race in the swing state of Wisconsin, and Republicans won two special Congressional elections in Florida. Dane County Circuit Court Judge Susan Crawford won an open seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court to maintain the court’s 4-3 liberal majority. Crawford easily won the non-partisan race, despite Trump’s narrow 2024 victory in the state. Voters also approved a ballot measure to enshrine the state’s voter ID requirement in the state constitution and reelected the state’s Superintendent of Public Instruction. Republicans expanded their thin margin in the House by winning two special elections in Florida. Two other seats, both last held by Democrats, are currently vacant: one in Texas and one in Arizona. Republicans won two special Congressional elections in Florida, which were held to replace former GOP Reps. Michael Waltz and Matt Gaetz. While Waltz and Gaetz both won by more than 30 percentage points in November, the special election results were considerably closer.
