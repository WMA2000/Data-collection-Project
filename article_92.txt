Sanders played four seasons of college football, two with Jackson State and two with Colorado under his father's coaching The Atlanta Falcons have apologised to Shedeur Sanders after their defensive co-ordinator's son helped to prank call the young quarterback during the NFL Draft. In video footage on social media, Sanders can be heard taking a call from someone purporting to be the New Orleans Saints' general manager Mickey Loomis. The caller tells Sanders the Saints will make him their next pick before saying that he is going to "have to wait a little bit longer". Sanders - whose father Deion began his storied NFL career with the Falcons - ended up being selected by the Cleveland Browns as the sixth pick of the fifth round and 144th overall. "Earlier in the week, Jax Ulbrich, the 21-year-old son of defensive co-ordinator Jeff Ulbrich, unintentionally came across the draft contact phone number for Shedeur Sanders off an open iPad while visiting his parent's home and wrote the number down to later conduct a prank call," said a Falcons statement. "Jeff Ulbrich was unaware of the data exposure or any facets of the prank and was made aware of the above only after the fact. "The Atlanta Falcons do not condone this behaviour and send our sincere apologies to Shedeur Sanders and his family, who we have been in contact with to apologise to, as well as facilitate an apology directly from Jax to the Sanders family. "We are thoroughly reviewing all protocols, and updating if necessary, to help prevent an incident like this from happening again." Jax Ulbrich also made an apology on social media, saying he had made a "tremendous mistake" and described what he did as "completely inexcusable, embarrassing, and shameful". He added: "I'm so sorry I took away from your moment, it was selfish and childish." Sanders, who had been tipped to be one of the first picks, eventually became the sixth quarterback selected in the draft and the second by the Browns. "It didn't really have an impact on me," said Sanders when asked about the prank call. "I think of course it was a childish act, but everybody does childish things here and there." Sanders' father Deion - who had a notable career during which he played cornerback in defence as well as a kick returner and wide receiver on offence - coached his son at Colorado. The NFL Hall of Famer also played in the World Series - the pinnacle of baseball - for the Atlanta Braves in 1992.
